        <p>Perkedel kentang (Indonesian potato fritters) is a ubiquitous everyday side dish in Indonesian, and is popular for lunch, dinner, or even as snacks! The humble perkedel is tasty and filling, and you will spot these everywhere in Indonesia, from street hawkers, tiny Mom-and-Pop family restaurants, all the way to fancy formal banquets.

            Interestingly, the name “perkedel” is derived from “frikandel”, a Dutch term for deep-fried minced meat patties. It becomes perkedel when we adopt it into our cuisine. Other varieties of perkedel also exist, such as perkedel tahu (tofu fritters), perkedel tempe (tempeh fritters) and perkedel jagung (corn fritters) to name a few.</p>
